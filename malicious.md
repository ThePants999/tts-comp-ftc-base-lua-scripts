# Malicious scripting in TTS

If you're here, you've probably seen the "Injection detected" warning in a game of 40K. What's all that about?

## Don't panic
Your PC is okay.

## So what's up?
A while ago, a sort-of-virus started doing the rounds in the TTS community. What this virus did was to attempt to fetch some code from a website and execute it, and then copy itself into every object on the table.

The website has been taken down, so the virus now does nothing actively harmful. However, copying itself into every object massively slows the game down (imagine - all the dice that you spawn wait for the virus to copy itself into them!). Then, if someone saves "infected" objects and spawns them in another game, it gets into that one too.

The 40K TTS community did a pass a while ago on eradicating the virus from model collections, but it's still lingering in some people's models.

## What do I need to do?

If you saw this error when someone else loaded their models into your game, you're OK - just don't keep saves from that game.

If you've seen this error from loading your own models, then one of your saved armies is infected, probably because one of the mods you got one of the models from is infected. You'll need to delete that save, and re-Yellowscribe from a clean source.
